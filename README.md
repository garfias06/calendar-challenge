# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
This work-day scheduler will help the user to plan for the day writing down any pending task or important events so the user can manage time effectively and performed as wished during the work shift.

## Usage
- Work scheduler will display current day and time to the user, showing a 9 time blocks to input important events for the day.

- When adding important events, the user will be able to save all this events to the local storage by clicking on the blue button on the right side of the text area, so when the web page is refreshed all the data will remain shown to the user so the track of events is kept on screen for the user to manage time.

- Another important feature this scheduler has is that it will notify the user when a task or event is in the past, present or future so time management can be performed effectively. Past is represented as gray color, present as red color, and future as green color.
